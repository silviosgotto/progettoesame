In the "src" folder you will find seven .js files, aimed at different parts of the process of creation and sonification of the map. These are Main.js, HarmonicNeurons.js, HarmonicSound.js, melodicNeurons.js,MelodicSound.js, RhythmNeurons.js and RhythmSound.js. <br> 

### 1) RhythmNeurons.js 
This .js file has the function to . <br>
We used the SVG.js web framework to draw the map and the geometric shape in which they are placed.
