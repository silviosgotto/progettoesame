- ## General infos

Blob is a project developed for the course Advance Coding Tools and Methodologies. <br>
The idea driving the project is the sonification of Kohonen Neural Network (KNN);(spiegare). <br>

We implemented the following web frameworks: Tone.js, Canvas API, Bootstrap.js, SVG.js. <br>
The project is optimized for Mozilla Firefox. <br>
- ## Kohonen Algorhythm


lo faccio dopo ingegneria del software.

- ## .js files
In the "src" folder you will find seven .js files, aimed at different parts of the process of creation and sonification of the map. These are Main.js, HarmonicNeurons.js, HarmonicSound.js, melodicNeurons.js,MelodicSound.js, RhythmNeurons.js and RhythmSound.js. <br> 

### 1) RhythmNeurons.js 
This .js file has the function to handle the graphic part of the RhythmPads. <br>
We used the SVG.js web framework to draw and animate the map and the geometric shape (triangle, square or pentagon) in which it is placed. <br>
The _learning_ function applies kohonen algorhythm to the map.

### 2) MelodicNeurons.js
This .js file has the function to handle the graphic part of the MelodicPad. <br>
We used the SVG.js web framework to draw and animate the map and the grid in which it is  placed. <br>
The _learning_ function applies kohonen algorhythm to the map. <br>

### 2) HarmonicNeurons.js
This .js file has the function to handle the graphic part of the HarmonicPad. <br>
We used the SVG.js web framework to draw and animate the map and the geometric shape (a circle) in which it is  placed. <br>
The _learning_ function applies kohonen algorhythm to the map. <br>
